# 🎬 Go Movie Data Toolkit: A Beginner's Guide to CSV Processing

## 📖 Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly toolkit designed to demonstrate how to use **Go (Golang)** to process large datasets. We use a dataset of over 9,000 movies to show how to read, parse, and interact with data using Go's powerful standard library.

Go was chosen for this project because it is:
* **Fast:** Ideal for processing large files quickly.
* **Statically Typed:** Helps catch errors early in the development process.
* **Simple:** Has a clean syntax that makes it a great "next step" after learning Python or JavaScript.

## 🛠 System Requirements
To run this project, you will need:
* **Operating System:** macOS, Windows, or Linux.
* **Go Compiler:** Version 1.18 or higher.
* **Text Editor:** Visual Studio Code (recommended) or any text editor.
* **Dataset:** The `movies.csv` file located in a `/data` folder.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions
1. **Install Go:** Download and install from [golang.org](https://go.dev/dl/).
2. **Clone the Project:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd <your-project-folder>
